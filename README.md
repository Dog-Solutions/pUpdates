Slogan "When everybody needs to be on the same page".

Christina, Shane, Nick And Jenny

The problem statement: There are multiple people with busy lives, coordinating care for their furry friends and they 
need a tool to help communicate about their pet's care. Pup-Dates will allow users to update eachother about what has
been done for their pets and "Keep everyone on the same page!'.
